# CSC455-Steganography-Project

### Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python (Version 3 for this test) installed on your machine.
2. Install the `stegano` module using pip:
	```sh
	pip3 install stegano
	```
3. Install the `pillow` module using pip:
   	```sh
	pip3 install pillow
    	``` 

### GUI Implementation

I added a simple GUI to the project (I tried to make it look somewhat modern, but I'm awful at designing GUIs in python)
The library works on JPG files as long as they are converted to png files when saved

```sh
python3 test.py
```
